ðŸš€ NeonCalc â€“ A Calculator That Glows With Style
Proud to share my latest project: NeonCalc, a modern, responsive calculator app designed with a glowing, minimal UI. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app supports basic arithmetic operations, real-time input display, keyboard-free interaction, and smooth UI transitions. Special features like AC, DEL, %, and evaluation error handling make it a user-friendly tool. Designed for performance and aesthetics, NeonCalc is a perfect blend of function and visual appeal.
